### checkrestart-gentoo
===
A fork of debian-goodies' checkrestart, adapted for Gentoo

Originally developed at http://arcdraco.net/checkrestart (now defunct)

### Dependencies
Python, sys-apps/lsb-release, app-portage/portage-utils, sys-process/lsof

### Todo list
* Merge patches lying around
* Better support for interpreter-based services (perl/python in priority)
* Add some aliases (mariadb->mysql init script)
